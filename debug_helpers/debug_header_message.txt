The issue persists - ultrathink, investigate the below logs THOROUGHLY, do your best to fix based on them.
If after you read the logs you still need more information to shed light on the problem, consider one or more of the following:
1. Add more log prints
2. Provide me a JS script I can run in the dev console as soon as i reproduce the problem. Remember to also copy it to the clipboard yourself (e.g. cat debug_artifacts/analysis_script.js | pbcopy). If you do
Then restart the server and let me know when you're done so that I'll reproduce the problem and you can continue investigating the logs.
If you added logs and/or JS script - notify me by putting üìÅ and/or üìú emojis at the end of the inference respectively.
