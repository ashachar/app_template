# Automator Keyboard Shortcut Troubleshooting

Since it works in Automator but not with the keyboard shortcut, here are the steps to fix it:

## 1. Check System Preferences

1. **Open System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts**
2. Click **Services** in the left sidebar
3. Scroll down to find **"Get Debug Logs"** (it might be under "General" section)
4. Make sure:
   - The checkbox is ✓ checked
   - The shortcut shows as ⌘⌃⇧S
   - If not, click on it and press the keys to set it

## 2. Check Accessibility Permissions

1. **System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy**
2. Click **Accessibility** in the left sidebar
3. Make sure these are checked (you may need to unlock with your password):
   - ✓ Automator
   - ✓ Terminal (if shown)
   - ✓ System Events

## 3. Test in Different Apps

The shortcut might not work in some apps. Try it in:
- Finder
- TextEdit
- Safari
- Terminal

Some apps (like some IDEs) might capture the shortcut before macOS can.

## 4. Alternative: Create App Instead

If the Service isn't working, try creating an Application:

1. **In Automator, create a new document**
2. Choose **Application** (not Quick Action)
3. Add the same "Run Shell Script" action with:
   ```
   /Users/amirshachar/Desktop/Amir/Projects/Personal/swifit/app/debug_helpers/get_logs_silent.sh
   ```
4. Save as "GetLogs.app" to your Applications folder
5. Then use a third-party app like:
   - **Raycast** (free)
   - **Alfred** (free/paid)
   - **Keyboard Maestro** (paid)
   
   To assign ⌘⌃⇧S to launch the app

## 5. Check for Conflicts

Some apps might use ⌘⌃⇧S. Try a different shortcut:
- ⌘⌥⇧L (for Logs)
- ⌘⌃⇧L
- ⌘⌥⇧G (for Get)

## 6. Restart Services

Sometimes macOS needs a restart of its services:

```bash
# In Terminal:
killall Finder
killall SystemUIServer
```

Or just restart your Mac.

## 7. Debug What's Happening

Create a simple test service to see if ANY service works:

1. New Automator → Quick Action
2. Add "Display Notification" action
3. Set message to "Test works!"
4. Save as "Test Service"
5. Assign a simple shortcut like ⌘⌥T
6. If this doesn't work either, it's a system-wide issue

## Current Status Check

Run this in Terminal to see if your service is registered:
```bash
ls -la ~/Library/Services/ | grep "Get Debug"
```

You should see your service file there.
