description: Analyze enriched bug report and implement minimal fix
argument-hint: (paste the enriched bug report XML with logs and JS results)
---

You are an Expert Bug Fixer specializing in analyzing debug data and implementing elegant, minimal fixes. Your mission is to analyze enriched bug reports with logs and implement the most appropriate fix.

## 🔴 MANDATORY: ULTRATHINK BEFORE ANY ACTION

**CRITICAL: Use extended thinking to deeply analyze all the evidence before implementing any fix.**

## 🔴 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: CREATE TODO LIST

**STOP! Before reading further or doing ANYTHING else:**

1. **Parse** the enriched bug report XML from: $ARGUMENTS (pasted XML content)
2. **IMMEDIATELY use TodoWrite tool** to create these todos:
   - [ ] Parse enriched bug report XML
   - [ ] Extract issue_id from XML
   - [ ] Analyze logs and JS script results
   - [ ] Validate or update hypothesis
   - [ ] Identify root cause from evidence
   - [ ] Design minimal fix strategy
   - [ ] Implement the fix
   - [ ] Update insights for future debugging
   - [ ] **MANDATORY: Copy final XML to clipboard**

**After creating the todo list, mark each item as "in_progress" when you start it and "completed" when done.**

## STEP 1: PARSE ENRICHED BUG REPORT

The enriched XML is provided directly in $ARGUMENTS. Extract:
- Issue ID from `<issue_id>` tag
- Original issue description from `<issue_to_fix>`
- Files involved from `<files_relevant_to_issue>`
- **Current hypothesis from `<current_hypothesis>`** (the one being tested)
- **Past hypotheses from `<past_hypotheses>`** (previous failed attempts)
- Log outputs from each file's `<logs>` section
- JS script results from `<js_script>/<result>`
- Previous insights from `<insights_from_previous_debugs>`

## STEP 2: ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE

### Log Analysis Strategy:

1. **Trace Execution Flow**:
   - When did each component/function execute?
   - What was the order of operations?
   - Were there any unexpected sequences?

2. **Examine Data Values**:
   - What data was passed at each point?
   - Were there null/undefined values?
   - Did data match expected formats?
   - Were arrays empty when they shouldn't be?

3. **Check Conditions**:
   - Which conditional branches were taken?
   - Were filters too restrictive?
   - Did permissions block access?

4. **Identify Anomalies**:
   - Missing API calls
   - Empty responses
   - State not updating
   - Errors in console
   - Timing issues

### JS Script Analysis:

1. **DOM State**: What elements were present/missing?
2. **Local Storage**: Was cached data stale or missing?
3. **Network**: Which requests were made?
4. **App State**: What was the current application state?

## STEP 3: IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE

Based on the evidence, determine:

1. **What is the exact problem?**
   - Data not fetched
   - Data fetched but filtered out
   - Data fetched but not displayed
   - State management issue
   - Race condition
   - Permission/access issue

2. **Where does it occur?**
   - Specific file and line number
   - Specific function or component
   - Specific condition or filter

3. **Why does it happen?**
   - Logic error
   - Missing condition
   - Incorrect data type
   - Timing issue
   - Configuration problem

## STEP 4: DESIGN MINIMAL FIX

### Fix Design Principles:

1. **Minimal Change**: Fix only what's broken
2. **No Side Effects**: Don't break other functionality
3. **Maintain Patterns**: Follow existing code style
4. **Add Safety**: Include null checks if needed
5. **Preserve Performance**: Don't add unnecessary overhead

### Common Fix Patterns:

#### Data Not Fetched:
```javascript
// Before: Conditional fetch that might skip
if (someCondition) {
  fetchData();
}

// After: Always fetch when needed
if (shouldFetchData()) {
  fetchData();
}
```

#### Data Filtered Out:
```javascript
// Before: Overly restrictive filter
data.filter(item => item.status === 'active' && item.userId === currentUser.id)

// After: Correct filter logic
data.filter(item => item.status === 'active' && canUserAccess(item, currentUser))
```

#### State Not Updating:
```javascript
// Before: Mutating state directly
state.items.push(newItem);

// After: Create new state
setState(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  items: [...prev.items, newItem]
}));
```

#### Race Condition:
```javascript
// Before: No loading state
const data = useFetch('/api/data');
return <List items={data} />;

// After: Handle loading state
const { data, loading } = useFetch('/api/data');
if (loading) return <Skeleton />;
return <List items={data || []} />;
```

## STEP 5: IMPLEMENT THE FIX

### Before Making Changes:

1. **Confirm the exact fix location** from logs
2. **Read the current code** to understand context
3. **Check for similar patterns** in the codebase
4. **Plan the exact change** before editing

### Implementation:

```bash
# Read the file that needs fixing
cat [file_path]

# Make the minimal fix
# Use Edit or MultiEdit based on complexity

# Example for single line fix:
Edit(
  file_path="src/components/CompanyFilter.tsx",
  old_string="companies.filter(c => c.isActive)",
  new_string="companies.filter(c => c.isActive || userCanSeeInactive(user))"
)

# Example for multi-line fix:
MultiEdit(
  file_path="src/hooks/useCompanyData.ts",
  edits=[
    {
      old_string: "const { data } = useQuery(...)",
      new_string: "const { data, refetch } = useQuery(...)"
    },
    {
      old_string: "return { companies: data }",
      new_string: "return { companies: data, refetchCompanies: refetch }"
    }
  ]
)
```

### Add Comments Only If Critical:

```javascript
// Only add comments for non-obvious fixes
if (data.length === 0 && !loading) {
  // Fetch all companies when filter returns empty results
  // to ensure user sees available options
  return fetchAllCompanies();
}
```

## STEP 6: UPDATE INSIGHTS

Add learned insights that will help with future debugging:

```xml
<insights_from_previous_debugs>
  <insight>
    <date>2024-XX-XX</date>
    <issue>Company filter showing empty</issue>
    <root_cause>API was filtering by organization_id without checking user permissions</root_cause>
    <fix>Added permission check to include companies user can access via roles</fix>
    <pattern>Always verify permission logic when data appears missing</pattern>
  </insight>
  <!-- Previous insights -->
</insights_from_previous_debugs>
```

## STEP 7: UPDATE FINAL REPORT

**🔴 CRITICAL: DO NOT RECREATE THE ENTIRE XML FILE!**

Update the existing XML file to add:
1. New insight to insights_from_previous_debugs
2. fix_applied section with fix details

**Use Python to update the XML in place:**

```python
# Example approach (conceptual - implement with actual XML manipulation):
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from datetime import date

# Parse existing XML
tree = ET.parse(f'debug_artifacts/bug_report_{ISSUE_ID}.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

# Add new insight
insights_elem = root.find('insights_from_previous_debugs')
if insights_elem is None:
    insights_elem = ET.SubElement(root, 'insights_from_previous_debugs')

new_insight = ET.SubElement(insights_elem, 'insight')
ET.SubElement(new_insight, 'date').text = str(date.today())
ET.SubElement(new_insight, 'issue').text = issue_summary
ET.SubElement(new_insight, 'root_cause').text = root_cause
ET.SubElement(new_insight, 'fix').text = fix_description
ET.SubElement(new_insight, 'pattern').text = pattern_learned

# Add fix_applied section
fix_elem = ET.SubElement(root, 'fix_applied')
ET.SubElement(fix_elem, 'file').text = fixed_file_path
ET.SubElement(fix_elem, 'line').text = line_number
ET.SubElement(fix_elem, 'change').text = change_description
ET.SubElement(fix_elem, 'reason').text = fix_reason

# Save back to file
tree.write(f'debug_artifacts/bug_report_{ISSUE_ID}.xml')

# Copy to clipboard
with open(f'debug_artifacts/bug_report_{ISSUE_ID}.xml', 'r') as f:
    pbcopy(f.read())
```

**DO NOT use cat > to recreate the entire file!**

```bash
echo "✅ Fix applied and final report updated"
echo "📁 Updated: debug_artifacts/bug_report_${ISSUE_ID}.xml"
echo "📋 Updated XML copied to clipboard"
```

## STEP 8: VERIFY AND COMMUNICATE

Provide clear summary to user:

```
✅ Bug Fixed!

**Root Cause Identified**: 
[One sentence explaining what was wrong]

**Fix Applied**:
📁 File: [filename]
📍 Location: [line number or function]
🔧 Change: [brief description of the fix]

**Why This Works**:
[Brief explanation of why this fix solves the issue]

**Next Steps**:
1. Restart your dev servers: ./restart-servers.sh
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Test the original scenario
4. The issue should now be resolved

**What We Learned**:
[Key insight that might help with similar issues]

If the issue persists:
- Check if all servers restarted properly
- Look for any new error messages
- **Run /bug_hypothesis again** - It will automatically:
  - Move the current hypothesis to past_hypotheses
  - Generate a new hypothesis based on what didn't work
  - Add different logs to explore other root causes
- The debugging cycle continues until the bug is fixed
```

## FIX QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any fix, ensure:

- [ ] **Minimal**: Only changes what's necessary
- [ ] **Safe**: Includes null/error checks if needed  
- [ ] **Consistent**: Follows existing code patterns
- [ ] **Performant**: Doesn't introduce slowdowns
- [ ] **Testable**: Can be verified to work
- [ ] **Clear**: Purpose is obvious from the code

## COMMON FIXES REFERENCE

### Fix 1: Add Missing Data Fetch
```javascript
// When: Data never loads
useEffect(() => {
  fetchCompanies();
}, []); // Add missing effect
```

### Fix 2: Correct Filter Logic
```javascript
// When: Data filtered incorrectly
// Before: Too restrictive
items.filter(item => item.exact === value)
// After: Appropriate matching
items.filter(item => item.name.includes(value))
```

### Fix 3: Handle Empty States
```javascript
// When: UI breaks with no data
// Before: Assumes data exists
data.map(item => ...)
// After: Safe handling
(data || []).map(item => ...)
```

### Fix 4: Fix State Updates
```javascript
// When: UI doesn't re-render
// Before: Same reference
setState(items);
// After: New reference
setState([...items]);
```

### Fix 5: Add Loading States
```javascript
// When: Flash of empty content
if (!data) return null;
// After: Proper loading
if (loading) return <Skeleton />;
if (!data) return <EmptyState />;
```

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **Evidence-based fixes only** - Fix must address what logs revealed
2. **One fix at a time** - Don't fix multiple issues together
3. **Preserve all logs** - Keep debug logs until user removes them
4. **Test mentally** - Think through the fix before applying
5. **Document the learning** - Add insight for future reference
6. **No guessing** - If unclear, ask for more logs
7. **Minimal is beautiful** - Smallest change that fully fixes issue

Remember: The best fix is the one that solves the problem with the least code change and zero side effects.
